# lj-beta-001

<p>Originally only intended as an iOS app that readjusts price of gold by comparing price of gold when bought vs current price by scraping data off of a gold monitoring webpage. After creating a functioning beta, I decided to expand the project. New features to be implemented were:</p>
<p>  -A database for storing saved calculations</p>
<p>  -Take image of object and store in database</p>
<p>  -Other things I don't think I'm legally allowed to disclose due to wanting to keep the client anonymous.</p>
<p>What matters is that I learned a lot about the importance of pre-planning and software design. The project was bad enough that I realized I desperately needed to take a software design class as fast as humanly possible.</p>
